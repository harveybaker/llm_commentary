This sector had the most significant positive impact on total return, primarily due to strong stock selection, although the allocation effect slightly underperformed. \\n\\nThe Fund's position in Pinterest, the American image sharing and social media service, has proven to be beneficial, making it the number one positive contributor to total return. Pinterest's platform, which enables the discovery of ideas through images, GIFs, and videos, continues to be a popular choice among internet users.\\n\\nHowever, the Fund experienced a setback with ZoomInfo, a software and data company that provides data for companies and individuals. Despite being the number one negative contributor to total return in the Communication Services sector, ZoomInfo has announced a significant increase in expected growth for the coming year, which could potentially offset its recent underperformance.\\n\\nThe Fund's position in the Communication Services sector was maintained during this quarter.\"\n",
